# README

A course at Chapman University Spring 2023 as a section of CPSC 298, the Computer Science Colloquium, which offers one credit courses (one lecture per week) on a current topic of interest. The title of this section is

## Introduction to Smart Contracts

(created by [Alexander Kurz](https://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/alexander-kurz) and [Ronan Kearns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronank/) from Chapman and [Jeff Turner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/composedao/) and Stephen Preston from ComposeDAO)

**Lectures:** Feb 1 - May 10 in Keck 153, Wed 12-1pm. No classes March 22 (Spring break).  
**Discord:**  We use Discord for discussions and further teaching materials.

The purpose of the course is to give a hands-on introduction in how to develop a dApp using smart contracts.

## Required Steps for Testing and Deployment

Install Foundry -> https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html

```
npm i 
forge install 
```

Configure `.env` file -> see [`.env.example`](https://github.com/alexhkurz/introduction-to-smart-contracts/blob/main/.env.example). (Go to your Metamask, follow "Goerli test network->Account details->Export private key" and enter the private key in your `.env` (for the `PRIVATE_KEY` variables); make an account with [alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), create a test app for the Ethereum chain on the Goerli network and fill in the value for `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`.)

This framework has been written to use various testnets and mainnets. Test ETH has been encoded into the tasks for localhost deployment. For testnets, test ETH, BNB, or ETC is required which can be received from their corresponding faucets. An .env is used for running on other networks outside of localhost.

Configured Networks:

- Localhost
- Goerli. Faucet: https://goerlifaucet.com/
- Sepolia. Faucet: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- BSC Testnet. Faucet: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
- BSC.
- Mordor. Faucet: https://easy.hebeswap.com/#/faucet

## NPM Commands

```
npm run compile # runs hardhat compile
npm run clean # runs hardhat clean
npm run test # runs unit tests via Forge
```

On some systems `npm run compile` raises an error [^error] that can be circumvented by running `nvm install 14`.

## Hardhat Tasks

### Deployment

To deploy your contract use

```
npx hardhat --network <network_name> deploy --contract <contract_name> --arg <constructor_argument>
```

For example, 

```
npx hardhat --network sepolia deploy --contract Treasury --arg 0x7169D38820dfd117C3FA1f22a697dBA58d90BA06
```

**Exercise:** Inspect [`Treasury.sol`](contracts/Treasury.sol) and explain what role the argument `0x7169D38820dfd117C3FA1f22a697dBA58d90BA06` plays. Google it and look it up on Etherscan. It is a well-known stable coin.

If you get `Error: insufficient funds` go to a faucet (see links above), use your Alchemy login, and enter the wallet address you get from your Metamask wallet. If everything worked you see in your terminal

`Contract deployed to: <deployed_contract_address>`

**Example:** When we run the command above, our smart contract was created on the Sepolia testnet at [`0x1b1cDCdBEFd2088C32ca0655CE01E5124F39C116`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b1cDCdBEFd2088C32ca0655CE01E5124F39C116#code).

### Verification

To "verify" your contract (ie to display the code [on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b1cDCdBEFd2088C32ca0655CE01E5124F39C116#code)) run

```
npx hardhat --network <network_name> verify <deployed_contract_address> <constructor_argument>
```

If you get `Error [...] no API token was found` go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), create an account, get an API-key and add it to your `.env` 

Now you should be able to interact via your Metamask wallet with your contract on the testnetwork.

### Summary of hardhat commands:

```
npx hardhat # lists all available hardhat tasks

npx hardhat --network <network_name> balance --account <account_address> # retrieves account balance on specified network

npx hardhat --network <network_name> deployproxy --contract <contract_name> # Deploys provided upgradeable contract to specified network. Proxy type is UUPS

npx hardhat --network <network_name> flatten <contract_file_path> > <output_file_path> # Flattens contracts and dependecies to output file

npx hardhat --network <network_name> initialize --contract <contract_name> --contract-address <deployed_contract_address> # Initializes provided upgradeable contract on specified network

npx hardhat --network <network_name> validateupgrade --contract <new_contract_name> --proxy-address <deployed_proxy_contract_address> # Validates new implementation contract without deploying it

npx hardhat --network <network_name> deploy --contract <contract_name> --arg <constructor_argument> # Deploys given contract to specified network

npx hardhat --network <network_name> verify <deployed_contract_address> <constructor_argument> # verifies source code on Etherscan or BSCSCAN. Supported networks are Goerli, BSC, BSC Testnet
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error similar to this:
```
[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\<USER>\src\introduction-to-smart-contracts\artifacts\build-info\02c99f9d2dcfd295a0c0fe2cc9481c42.json'] {
  errno: -4058,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'open',
  path: 'C:\\Users\\<USER>\\src\\introduction-to-smart-contracts\\artifacts\\build-info\\02c99f9d2dcfd295a0c0fe2cc9481c42.json'
}
```
Then run: `npm run clean`

## Deno and Aleph

### Setting up a Deno webserver linked to Github

[`https://spreston8-cspc-298-website.deno.dev/`](https://spreston8-cspc-298-website.deno.dev/): An example webserver that can be used to donate money to a project. It runs on Deno and Aleph.js and includes wallet connect.

Steps to deploy your own site to https://deno.com/deploy

1. Go to https://deno.com/deploy and sign up/sign in. Needs github access.
2. Make sure your repo is uptodate with this one. In particular, it should contain the `frontend` folder.
3. Create a new project and link your github repo to project with entrypoint being `frontend/server.ts`. Choose "automatic".
4. Modify `frontend/sponsorship.ts` to include your contract address for goerli testnet. Contract must include `deposit` function found in `Treasury.sol`
5. Push your changes to update published site

The result of following these steps in the current repo is [here](https://intro-smart-contracts.deno.dev/).

### Installing Deno locally

If you want to install Deno locally:

[Deno installation](https://deno.com/manual@v1.33.1/getting_started/installation)

[Aleph.js](https://alephjs.org/)

Run the webserver locally:

```
cd frontend
deno task dev
```
